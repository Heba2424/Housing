# Housing_Regreission_Model
## Data :
In this data we have 20640 rows and 10 columns(Features) About this Features :

westlatitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north.

Firstly ,We collect data from California dataset to train the
model, Then checked correlation between features and fin
median_income is the high correlation ,then we Create new
features to improve the performance of the model, then
Chose the appropriate model for our problem, and find
Random Forest Regression as it gives us the lowest RMSE
value that is we need .
